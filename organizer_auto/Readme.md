In this instance, I present a straightforward code to organize a folder like the Downloads folder, effectively categorizing documents into distinct folders based on their file extensions. This approach eliminates the frustrating scenario of having hundreds of PDFs, tens of TXTs, fifteen JPGs, and numerous other files jumbled together without any organization.

The os and shutil libraries will be utilized to accomplish these tasks. Both are readily available in Python. The **os library** provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with the operating system. It offers functions for navigating directories, accessing file system information, handling date and time operations, compressing and decompressing data, managing network connections, and sending emails. **The shutil library**, on the other hand, focuses on managing files and collections of files. It provides functions for copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files.
